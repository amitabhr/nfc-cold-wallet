# NFC cold wallet for Kusama

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to build a solution for storing wallet seed securely offline by using NFC tags and industry standard cryptography and encryption.

## Why NFC?
- NFC or Near-Field-Communication is a set of communication protocols for communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm or less.
Very similar to RFID, but a disatvantage of RFID is that it can be read from a distance, which makes them unsuitable for storing sensitive data.

- All the new mobile phones are equipped with NFC readers today which makes them an ideal candidate for broader adoption.
